Why "HERE1" Is Not Getting Printed
Reason: The function that prints "HERE1" is sent to the channel, but there are several reasons why it might not get executed:
The main function terminates almost immediately after printing "Hello". Since main exits, the program also exits, 
and the goroutines may not have enough time to pick up the task from the channel and execute it.
There's no synchronization to ensure that the goroutines have time to process the function from the channel before the program exits.
The goroutines are started but may not have had a chance to start reading from the channel before main finishes.


How to Ensure "HERE1" Is Printed
To ensure "HERE1" is printed, you need to give the goroutines enough time to execute the function from the channel before the main function exits. 
One way to achieve this is by using synchronization techniques such as sync.WaitGroup

Code:

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
)

func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    wg.Add(1) // Add a counter for the function to be executed

    cnp := make(chan func(), 10)
    for i := 0; i < 4; i++ {
        go func() {
            for f := range cnp {
                f()
            }
        }()
    }

    cnp <- func() {
        fmt.Println("HERE1")
        wg.Done() // Decrement the counter when the function is done
    }

    fmt.Println("Hello")
    wg.Wait() // Wait until all functions have finished
}


In this example, sync.WaitGroup is used to wait for the function execution to complete before allowing main to exit.

This ensures that "HERE1" is printed by synchronizing the main function with the execution of the function sent to the channel.
